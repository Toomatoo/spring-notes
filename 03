Spring Tutorial 03: Spring Bean Factory
====================================================================================================

1. Spring is a container of Beans
- Spring manages the objects: life cycle, etc.
- So that Spring need some handlers to control the objects.

2. Factory Pattern
- When a object in the container creates a new object?
- This object need to ask a object factory to create a object on demand.
- String Bean Factory
-- Object ask the factory to create a object
-- Factory finds some configure in Spring XML
-- Bean Factory creates the actual object asked.
- What we need to do
-- 1. object in the container asks
-- 2. Spring XML
-- 3. New Object is under control of Spring
