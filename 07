Spring Tutorial 07: Injecting Object
====================================================================================================
The situation is
When a Object o1 is requested, then the factory is supposed to generate the object o1, using
`getBean` here.
But always there are other object as member variables in the object o1. Under this situation, the
member objects are also supposed to be generated by the factory.

The action is
1. we still need to add a bean in the configure xml file. And the beans are much similar to the
   above object o1.
   - Use property tag to use setter of some variable
   - Use constructor-arg to use the constructor of the class


2. when writing the bean of the object o1, I need to generate member object variables.
   - Still use property tag, still name parameter,
   - But add a ref tag which refers to a bean that can set the member object variable.

---
The properties are objects, use "ref" tag to refer other beans which denotes some other objects.
Of course, I need to create other beans of the 'point1'...
<bean id="triangle" class="me.tomato.InjectingObjectsTriangle" name="triangle2">
   <property name="pointA" ref="point1" />
   <property name="pointB" ref="point2"/>
   <property name="pointC" ref="point3" />
</bean>
---
Remember that the property tag use setter to set the value of the member variable, so that in the
definition of the class, I need to write setter and getter for the members.
