Spring Tutorial 10: Bean Autowiring
====================================================================================================
At present, if the target object has some member objects, we need to write new beans for these
members. And then write properties to set the value of the members.
Now I want to automatically set the members of the target object.

1. Use autowiring tag in the target object bean
---
<bean id="triangle" class="me.tomato.Triangle" autowire="byName" name="triangle2" />
---
- "byName" means autowiring exactly by name. When I have a variable with the same name of a bean.
  It will be assigned automatically.

2. Also write setter and getter in the class

* Autowire is not something very convenient. For debugging and other things, use properties to
  initialize the members is a clear way.
