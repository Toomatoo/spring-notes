# Spring Tutorial 12: Using ApplicationContextAware

## ApplicationContextAware

We can provide our beans with access to the ApplicationContext Object by implementing the `ApllicationContextAware` interface.

After implementing the interface, our object can access the current context.

For our Triangle, I implement `ApplicationContextAware` interface

``` java
public class Triangle implements ApplicationContextAware{}
```
Then override the `setApplicationContext` method
``` java
public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException {
    this.context = applicationContext;
}
```

## BeanNameAware

We can provide our beans with access to the bean name in the configure file.

Like in our example, the name for a Triangle object is `triangle`. For each Object created by the factory can know the name.

The method is to implement BeanNameAware for a specific class.

For our Triangle, I implement BeanNameAware.

``` java
public class Triangle implements BeanNameAware{}
```

And then override the method setBeanName

``` java
public void setBeanName(String name) {
    System.out.println("The bean name for this object is: " + name);
}
```

And when creating a object of Triangle, the factory will first call the setter in construction.


## Point
For these two kinds of interfaces, actually, we make the object from the factory contain more information for the factory. Maybe in the future, we can take use of it.
