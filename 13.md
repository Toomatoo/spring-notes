# Spring Tutorial 13: Bean Definition Inheritance

## parent

### General Use

For the definition of beans, sometimes we want inheritance mechanism for the beans in the configure files. At this time, we consider defining beans with inheritance.

First we create a bean of parent. For example, in the definition of triangle in `spring.xml`. Using the keyword `parent="parentBeanName"`

```xml
<bean id="parentTriangle" class="me.tomato.Triangle">
       <property name="point1" ref="point1" />
</bean>
<bean id="triangle" class="me.tomato.Triangle" parent="parentTriangle">
       <property name="point2" ref="point2"/>
</bean>
```

In this way, for some definition of a bean, we can inherit from a parent bean which has defined some properties.

### Use with a list member

If the class of the bean has a list member, in a definition of bean, we will add element into the list. Look, if we want to continue adding elements into the list with inheriting from parent bean, we can do it.

First, we define a list in the class with getter and setter,
```java
List<Point> points = new ArrayList<Point>();

public void setPoints(List<Point> points) {
    this.points = points;
}

public List<Point> getPoints() {
    return points;
}
```
Then we modify the configure xml file to
```xml
<bean id="parentTriangle" class="me.tomato.Triangle">
       <property name="points" >
               <list>
                      <ref bean="point1" />
               </list>
       </property>
</bean>
<bean id="triangle" class="me.tomato.Triangle" parent="parentTriangle">
      <property name="points">
             <list merge="true">
                    <ref bean="point2"/>
                    <ref bean="point3"/>
             </list>
      </property>
</bean>
```
See we first add a element into the list in the parent definition. Then write the child bean to continue adding elements into the list.

Also it should be mentioned that `merge="true"` is used to indicate that the child bean will merge the elements into the parent bean instead of replacing it.

One more thing, we can make the parent bean `abstract` by adding a parameter `abstact="true"` into the tag `bean`, like
```xml
<bean id="parentTriangle" class="me.tomato.Triangle" abstact="true">
```

Done.
