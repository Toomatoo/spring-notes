# Spring Tutorial 14: Lifecycle Callbacks

Sometimes, we want the beans have life cycles. It means the bean will be initialized and destroyed as well.

## AbstractApplicationContext

First I use `AbstractApplicationContext` instead of `ApplicationContext` in the main method. And call `registerShutdownHook` method first. The function here is to enable the Initialization and destroy processes.

```java
AbstractApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("spring.xml");
context.registerShutdownHook();
Triangle triangle = (Triangle) context.getBean("triangle");
triangle.draw();
```

Second, I can implement `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` for `Triangle`. The function for
these two interfaces is that when the bean is initialized or destroyed, some methods will be called.
Actually `afterPropertiesSet` and `destroy`.

```java
public void destroy() throws Exception {
    System.out.println("Triangle destroyed.");
}

@Override
public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
    System.out.println("Triangle initialized.");
}
```
Then the experiment result is
```text
Triangle initialized.
Triangle initialized.
Point: 0 0
Point: 20 0
Point: -20 10
Triangle destroyed.
Triangle destroyed.
```

One thing is that I've tested this without using `AbstractApplicationContext`. The result is that
`afterPropertiesSet` is called, `destroy` not.


## The other way when init and destroy

Above, we implement two interfaces for initialization and destroy. Sometimes, we don't want to
explicitly implement these interfaces. Under this situation, we have a another way.

First, we write our own `myInit` and `myDestroy` methods in the `Triangle`.

```java
public void myInit() {
    System.out.println("My init method called");
}
public void mydestroy() {
    System.out.println("My destroy method called");
}
```
Then we add parameters into the bean tag, `init-method="myInit" destroy-method="myDestroy"`. Then
the methods will be automatically called.

We can keep the interfaces `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` and all
the methods will be called. And the methods in `InitializingBean` and `DisposableBean` will be
called first.

One more thing is that we can make a default init and destroy methods for all the beans. We can
simply add the parameters `deafult-init-method="myInit" default-destroy-method="myDestroy"` into the
tag `beans`. And spring will automatically find the methods in the classes.
