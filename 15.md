# Spring Tutorial 15: Writing a BeanPostProcessor

In the previous post, I learnt how to have some actions when creating beans and destroying beans.
There is a way to integrate the thing. It is a Bean Processor.

## Write a BeanPostProcessor

First, I write a new class named `DisplayNameBeanPostProcessor` which acts as a BeanPostProcessor
for my own.
```java
public class DisplayNameBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor{
    @Override
    public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
        System.out.println("BeanPostProcessor before init: " + beanName);
        return bean;
    }

    @Override
    public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
        System.out.println("BeanPostProcessor after init: " + beanName);
        return bean;
    }
}
```

It implements a interface, and we need to override two methods `before` and `after`.

Second, tell spring that it is the BeanPostProcessor.
```xml
<bean class="me.tomato.DisplayNameBeanPostProcessor" />
```
Then spring will know it is a BeanPostProcessor because it implements `BeanPostProcessor`. And spring
will call the methods before/after initialization of beans.
