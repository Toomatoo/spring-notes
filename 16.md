# Spring Tutorial 16: BeanFactoryPostProcessor

For this time, I learnt a mechanism to write a class which takes actions when initializing a bean
factory.

## BeanFactoryPostProcessor

First, I write a new class of my BeanFactoryPostProcessor which implements `BeanFactoryPostProcessor`
```java
public class MyBeanFactoryPP implements BeanFactoryPostProcessor {
    @Override
    public void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException {
        System.out.println("My Bean Factory Postprocessor called.");
    }
}
```
Then like a BeanPostProcessor, I just add a bean tag into the beans in the configure xml file.
```xml
<bean class="me.tomato.MyBeanFactoryPP" />
```
And spring will automatically know it is a BeanPostProcessor because it implements `BeanPostProcessor`.

The function for BeanPostProcessor is to take some actions when initializing a bean factory.

One thing is to config the configure file before creating beans.

## PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer

As is said above, the configure file can also be initialized. In our example, there are some beans
for points. The coordinates value are fixed in the previous definition. However, we can use a
Bean Factory Processor to configure the beans.

Here I use PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer which can take in a property configure file and put the
values into beans.

First write a new property file to store some value. For example, in a new file `pointsproperty.properties`,
```text
point.valueX = 0
point.valueY = 0
```
And prepare it for later use.

Second we rewrite a point bean
```xml
<bean id="point1" class="me.tomato.Point">
      <property name="x" value="${point.valueX}" />
      <property name="y" value="${point.valueY}" />
</bean>
```
As is shown above, we can use the format `${valueName}` to refer some value in a properties configure
file.

Third, write a bean in `spring.xml` to indicate that there is a BeanPostProcessor for the factory.
```xml
<bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
       <property name="locations" value="pointsproperty.properties"/>
</bean>
```
As is shown above, `PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer` can link a properties file with this factory, and
makes beans have the ability to use values of properties in the file. Add a property for it, and
set the value the file path to the properties file.

Then all the stuff is done, and the point1 bean can create a Point object with some values written
in the properties file.
